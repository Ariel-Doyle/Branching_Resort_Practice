  <h1>Travel Arrangements</h1>
  <p>
    We want only the smoothest options for travel to and from both the island and the resort, that's why we work exclusively with 
    <a href="https://traveltoparadise.com/">Travel To Paradise</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you should choose to plan your stay with us on your own, we are accessible by all the major taxi services. The bus route 29 has a stop at the bottom of the hill (stop 326), after which we can send out a shuttle to retrieve you and your luggage. Please call (111)222-3333 EXT 447 to make arrangements with the resort.
